Applicants score (on a daily basis) their energy levels, their happiness, their sense of productivity, their sense of fulfillment, how good of a day theyâ€™re having, and maybe one or two other metrics. They also register life events (work, home, relationships, friends, finance, family, etc.). The app then helps to construct a timeline of wellness (think line graphs with markers).

---

A user opens the site. It says, "You haven't added metrics today. How are you?" Then it lists a bunch of fields for number-input corresponding to questions like those in the description above.

Then they're done!

Or maybe it says, "You've already added metrics today. Nice."

So now, they can also add Life Events. Like "I had a fight with my best friend."

Imagine doing this for several months. Then you can go to the site and "See Report", which shows each day's happiness metrics. And it's interspersed with life events, so you can see if that fight with your friend affected certain metrics.

Bonus: Have the report be a cool-looking line graph (See *morris.js*).
